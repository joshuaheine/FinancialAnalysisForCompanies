# Repository for Financial Analysis For Companies

This programme gives a simple financial analysis on multiple companies based on the stock ticker.

This is a showcase on preparing and visualize stock data.

The goal of this project is to show a simple stock analysis, gathering of that data and use an LSTM to show predicted vs actual results.

Last update date: 27/1/2023

Improvements:
- Could have applied backpropgation and/or dropout and use other methods to make sure that the model could have been more accurate.
- More data could have been provided by adding 2008 to add previous data from an economic collapse.
- Better packages could have been used to gather data from Yahoo finance such as yfinance package.
- Could use real time results and make prodictions.
- Could have used a Stacked LSTM and used hyper-parameters to get more accurate results.
